#Stock Trading & Capital Gains Calculator (Java)

This Java program simulates basic stock trading and calculates **capital gains or losses** using a custom **Linked Deque** implementation.  
It processes buy and sell transactions, tracks share lots, and applies **FIFO logic** to determine total profit or loss.

### Features
- Implements a **custom Deque data structure** using linked nodes  
- Processes sequential stock buy/sell transactions  
- Calculates **capital gains/losses** based on FIFO order  
- Object-Oriented Design: modular classes for stock lots and tracker logic  

### Concepts Practiced
- Java OOP (classes, encapsulation, modular design)  
- Data Structures (Deque, Linked Lists)  
- Algorithmic Thinking & Financial Computation  

### Files
- `StockTradingApp.java` – main driver  
- `StockTracker.java` – handles transaction logic  
- `StockLot.java` – represents each stock purchase lot  
- `LinkedDeque.java` / `DequeInterface.java` – custom deque implementation
